      try to build plug-and-play vision-based inspection for industrial
      settings. You can find me by <strong>torayeff</strong> handle on

    <h2>Some of my random thoughts:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        2024-04-27: Digital workers are the future. They will make a dent in
        industries relying on repetitive tasks such as customer support, human
        interaction, product advertisement, and sales. However, they might
        struggle in industries relying on super accuracy, such as finance,
        regulation, law, and medicine.
      </li>
      <li>
        2024-04-27: In the next 5 years, we can expect a software revolution in
        industrial robotics. Specifically in robot controllers and their
        operating systems. Similar to Symbian OS vs Android OS.
      </li>
      <li>
        2024-04-27: I thought that LLMs were cool, then I thought hype. Now I
        again think that they are cool.
      </li>
      <li>
        2024-04-27: At the moment I believe that companies checking regulations
        and doing due diligence in fintech with LLMs will not survive. Mostly
        because of hallucinations.
